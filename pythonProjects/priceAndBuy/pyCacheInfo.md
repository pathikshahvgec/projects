In the world of computer architecture, we usually deal with two types of memory: Main memory and Cache memory. Think of Cache memory as a quick-access stash for data that we often need, helping to speed up the process when we fetch information from Main memory.

Now, let’s relate this to Python! When you run a Python source file (.py), it often contains multiple modules or libraries—some of which may be third-party or developed by users—that need to be imported. The good news is that most of these modules don’t change very often compared to your main script. So, when they’re first used, they get compiled into bytecode (.pyc) and stored in a special directory called __pycache__.

What’s great about this is that when you run your main Python file repeatedly, it can quickly grab the bytecode of those modules directly from __pycache__ without having to recompile them. This little trick speeds up the execution of your code and makes your coding experience smoother!
