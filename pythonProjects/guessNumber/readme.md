I’ve created a fun number-guessing game that you might recognize!

In this game, I've chosen a random number between 1 and 100, and your challenge is to guess it with the fewest tries possible.
If you follow a strategy like binary search, you could get it in about 7 guesses. But don’t worry if it takes you a little longer at first—practice makes perfect!

A huge shoutout to Anvil for letting me create and host this web app for everyone to enjoy. Come join the fun and give it a try by clicking the link below:
